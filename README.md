# Oyster Sanctuary Monitoring Data Visualizer

North Carolina's Division of Marine Fisheries began the Oyster Sanctuary Program to create protected artificial reefs in an effort to restore the state's subtidal oyster population. 
Today, there are 15 oyster sanctuaries spanning 566 acres of protected subtidal habitat in Pamlico Sound. 
Each year, biologists conduct SCUBA surveys to collect oyster data on the performance of each sanctuary and the various materials used to build each reef. 
The code here utilizes streamlit to create an interactive dashboard that summarizes and visualizes the dataset from 2019-2023. 
The dashboard allows users to explore the Oyster Sanctuary Program's dataset and look for temporal changes and differences in how materials perform at the sanctuaries!
